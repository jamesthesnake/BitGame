Return whose turn it is Richards or Louise, That is whoever can't make a move when the counter N=1 
The turn starts with Louise  And it changes whenver N>1
IF N is not a power of 2 you reduce it by the closet power of two
if it has a power of two , divide it in half
once N==1  then the other person wins

\n The two inputs are first the number of games played, then each line after is the counter set for the game
